# Pacdora Clone (Full Structure - Example)

This repository is a scaffold for a Pacdora-like mockup generator, built as a Streamlit app.
It includes simple working code for mapping a 2D design onto basic mockups (2D composites),
plus PDF export. 3D models and dielines are included as placeholders for later replacement.

## How to run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
